#Sharpen My SQL
## Context File
Context.md contain summary of SQL knowledge and plan.

## How we work
1. When you have question or suggestion you have to create checklist of question in form of artifact.
2. I will respond your answer or suggestion one at a time so you have to prioritize your question and please ask with simple word with samples, you can repeat if my answer is not clear enough, and  show pros and cons with recommendation for each options
3. You will update the artifact with my answer and my reason and then ask another.
4. I want you to work with most recent and solid evident data.
